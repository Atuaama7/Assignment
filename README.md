# Individual Assignment- Create a Readme File. 
This project analyses the salary dataset that I Uplloaded in python, using a Pandas Library abd coding on Jupiter Notebook, This code includes various manipulation techniques that are very important, for instance my file includes techniques like, importing datasetsm calculating new columns, append, concatonate, filtering and grouping, etc., The main objective of teh dataset and coding through my file is to demonstrate effective data processing techniques for structured datasets which provides an efficient salary trend analysis.

## Getting Started
These instructions will help you get a copy of the project up and running on your local machine for development and testing purposes. See the deployment section for notes on how to deploy the project on a live system.

### Prerequisites
Before running the script, ensure you have the following installed:

Python 3.x (Download)

Pandas library (for data manipulation)

NumPy library (for numerical operations)

To install the required libraries, run:
pip install pandas numpy

#### Installing
Follow these steps to set up the project:


Ensure that the Salaries.csv file is placed in the correct directory.

Open the script in your preferred Python IDE (e.g., Jupyter Notebook, PyCharm, VS Code) or run it directly in the terminal.

###### Running the Tests
This script performs various data manipulation tasks. Below is a breakdown of key functionalities:

End-to-End Tests

Importing Data:

Reads a CSV file (Salaries.csv) into a Pandas DataFrame.

Displays the first few rows (.head()).

Checks dataset dimensions using .shape.

Adding New Columns:

Introduces a Benchmarks column with a constant value of 70,000.

Computes Salary_score as salary / Benchmarks, rounded to two decimal places.

Dropping Columns:

Demonstrates two methods to remove specific columns using .drop().

Creates dataset subsets with selected columns.

Appending Data:

Adds new records dynamically to a DataFrame.

Merges two DataFrames using pd.concat().

Grouping and Aggregation:

Groups data by rank and sex for trend analysis.

Uses .groupby() to count occurrences of different ranks and genders.

###### Coding Style Tests

The script follows Python best practices with structured functions.

Uses Pandas and NumPy for efficient data handling.

Code is structured for readability and reusability.

####### Deployment

This script is designed for local execution but can be extended for:

Integration with data analytics pipelines.

Web applications for salary insights.

Machine learning or statistical analysis.

To deploy on a live system:

Connect to a live database instead of a static CSV file.

Use cloud platforms (e.g., AWS, Google Cloud) for scalability.

Automate data retrieval and analysis with scheduling tools.
