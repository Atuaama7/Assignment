# Individual Assignment- Create a Readme File. 
This project analyses the salary dataset that I Uplloaded in python, using a Pandas Library abd coding on Jupiter Notebook, This code includes various manipulation techniques that are very important, for instance my file includes techniques like, importing datasetsm calculating new columns, append, concatonate, filtering and grouping, etc., The main objective of teh dataset and coding through my file is to demonstrate effective data processing techniques for structured datasets which provides an efficient salary trend analysis.

## Getting Started
These instructions will help you get a copy of the project up and running on your local machine for development and testing purposes. See the deployment section for notes on how to deploy the project on a live system.

#Prerequisites
Before running the script, ensure you have the following installed:

Python 3.x (Download)

Pandas library (for data manipulation)

NumPy library (for numerical operations)

To install the required libraries, run:
pip install pandas numpy

# Installing
Follow these steps to set up the project:

We have to make sure that the Salaries.csv file is in the right directory,

After that we have to make sure that script is opened in the python ide of your preference. (Jupyter Notebook or Pycharm).


# Running the Tests
This script executes different operations on data processing. The following list includes explanations of vital operational capabilities:

End-to-End Tests

Importing Data:

The script imports the Salaries.csv CSV file which transforms its data to a Pandas DataFrame.

The command .head() shows the initial lines of the data set.

Checks dataset dimensions using .shape.

Adding New Columns:

The script adds a Benchmarks column which contains the constant value 70,000.

A new column named Salary_score receives the value salary / Benchmarks with a rounding precision of two decimal places.

Dropping Columns:

Two approaches to delete particular columns are displayed using the .drop() function.

The program function splits input data into different subsets while choosing specific columns to work with.

Appending Data:

A DataFrame receives dynamically added new records through this operation.

Merges two DataFrames using pd.concat().

Grouping and Aggregation:

Groups data by rank and sex for trend analysis.

This query uses .groupby() to identify and count rank and gender combinations that appear in the data.

# Coding Style Tests

The script follows Python best practices with structured functions.

Uses Pandas and NumPy for efficient data handling.

Code is structured for readability and reusability.

# Deployment

This script is designed for local execution but can be extended for:

Integration with data analytics pipelines.

Web applications for salary insights.

Machine learning or statistical analysis.

To deploy on a live system:

Connect to a live database instead of a static CSV file.

Use cloud platforms (e.g., AWS, Google Cloud) for scalability.

Automate data retrieval and analysis with scheduling tools.
